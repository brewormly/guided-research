# Evaluating Semantic Linking Capabilities of Engineering-Specific Word Embeddings Across Languages

Hi there! This is the report of my guided research conducted during my Master's degree in Data Engineering and Analytics at TUM. A summary and more information can be found [here](https://wwwmatthes.in.tum.de/pages/7dzpd6msesw4/Guided-Research-Peter-Weinberger). Enjoy!

## Update

The results of this work have been published as a conference paper at the 4th International Conference on Management Science and Industrial Engineering!
